So you've built your app, tested it in development mode, and now you're ready to deploy it to a servlet container. Let's assume that your app root directory is named _golf-example_.

Open a terminal. In the app root directory do:

bc. golf --war .

That will produce a war file named _golf-example.war_ in the app root directory. Upload that to your servlet container, and you're in business.
