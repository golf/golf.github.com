1. Download the latest Golf distribution zip file here: "golf.zip":http://cloud.github.com/downloads/golf/golf/golf.zip

2. Unzip the zip file into a directory that's in your path. For example, you could probably use @~/bin@.

That's all. Now you can open a terminal and do:

bc. golf --help

This will print the Golf command line usage and options page.
