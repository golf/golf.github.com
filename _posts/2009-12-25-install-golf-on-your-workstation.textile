1. Download the latest Golf distribution zip file here: "golf-latest.zip":http://cloud.github.com/downloads/golf/golf/golf-latest.zip

2. Unzip the zip file into a directory that's in your path. For example, you could probably use @~/bin@.

That's all. Now you can open a terminal and do this:

bc. golf --help

and see the Golf jar file usage page which describes how to use the Golf jar and lists all the options that are available.
