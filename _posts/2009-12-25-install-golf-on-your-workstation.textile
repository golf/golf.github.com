First, get the latest version of the Golf jar file and put it somewhere in your path. We'll assume that it's going to be in the @~/bin@ directory, and that that directory is in your path. From a bash terminal do the following:

bc. curl http://cloud.github.com/downloads/golf/golf/golf-latest.jar > golf.jar
mv golf.jar ~/bin
echo 'java -jar "$(dirname "$0")"/golf.jar "$@"' > ~/bin/golf
chmod 755 ~/bin/golf

Now you should be able to do this:

bc. golf --help

and see the Golf jar file usage page which describes how to use the Golf jar and lists all the options that are available.
