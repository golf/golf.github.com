title: "Conventions 1: Dierctory Structure And Special Files"
author: Micha Niskin

Golf provides a fairly complex and flexible framework in which to build and deploy your web applications. One of the overriding design goals has been to simplify app development as much as possible.

In order to reduce the amount of time spent editing configuration files we chose _convention_ over _configuration_. Golf aims to provide a very consistent and predictable set of conventions.

h2. Directory Structure

Golf applications are contained in a single directory. This directory is what we call the _app root directory_. Inside this directory there are a number of (optional) subdirectories that have special significance.

* @components@ This directory contains all of the application's components. Within this directory is a heirarchy similar to the Java package system. The component namespace is determined by the location of the component directory. For example, the component located at @<approot>/components/com/example/Hello@ would be instantiated as @new Component.com.example.Hello()@.
